# Section

To dynamically include a table use: 

```{r my-table, echo = FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 5), caption = "Sample table")
```

Tables can be referenced with `\@ref(tab:my-table)`, where `my-table` is
the name of the code chunk. e.g. Please see Table \@ref(tab:my-table)...

## Subsection

To dynamically include a table use: 

```{r my-figure, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Sample figure", fig.pos="H"}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```

Referencing a figure is done using `\@ref(fig:my-figure)`, where `my-figure` is
the name of the code chunk. e.g. Please see Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)...
